This plugin makes it super easy to send push notifications to people who subscribe to your WordPress blog using Pronto Push.

== Description ==

Users will be prompted when they first visit your website (if they're running Mac OS X 10.9) if they'd like to subscribe to your website via Pronto Push to receive push notifications.

A Pronto Push account is super easy to make and only takes a matter of seconds for a reader to get their account setup and Mac added. 

The Pronto Push Dashboard allows you to see how many subscribers you have (detailed analytics coming v1.1).

== Installation ==

Open .zip file under the WordPress install window. Activate the plugin, then go to the Settings page under "Pronto Push". 

**You MUST have a Pronto Push account with a developer channel setup beforehand, http://prontopush.com/Developers**

It will ask you for your channel ID and push key which can be found on the developer page.
